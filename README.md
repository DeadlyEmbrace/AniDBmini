# Overview
AniDBmini is a small project that will attempt to produce an anidb.net client using their [UDP API](http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_API).
Some of the main features include:
* Ability to hash and add files to your list
* Media player hooking
* Local mylist database

This project was started to be a minimal alternative to *_AniDB o' Matic_*, which is no longer being developed_(?)_.

## Media Player Hooking
As of now the only supported media player is [Media Player Classic - Home Cinema](http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/).  "Media player hooking" provides the ability to launch
MPC-HC from AniDBmini, watch an episode of anime, and have it automatically added to your list and marked as watched, right as you finish watching it.
